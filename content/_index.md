# Phoenix Stroh
Hey there!

I'm a technical artist, programmer, and educator who's focused on making tools and systems for games.

I ride the dividing line between technology and art, having developed several tools for artists and designers to make their life easier. I love working closely with other people to coordinate many different talents and to provide assistance when possible. With a background of programming and a bachelor's in Animation & Game Art, I often fill in what is needed, including Programming, 3d Modeling, UI/UX, Animation, and Vfx.
